		<h2> The Road to Enlightenment </h2>
		<p> 
			Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of the browser-spefific tags,incompatible DOMs, and broken CSS support.
		</p>

		<p>	
			Today,we must clear the mind of past practices. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP and the major browser creators.
		</p>

		<p>
			The css Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lesson of the master.Begin to see with clarity.Learn to use the(yet to be) time-honored techniques in new and invigoranting fashion.Become one with the web
		</p>

		<h2> So What is This About? </h2>

		<p> 
			There is clearly a need for CSS to be taken srously by graphic artist.The Zen Garden aims to excite,inspire, and encourage participation. To begin,view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on anu one will load the style sheet into this very page. The code remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external .css file. Yes.really.
		</p>
		<p>
			CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. the only way this can be illustrated  in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are places in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. to date,most examples of neat trick and hack have been demostrated by structurists and coders. Designers have yet to make their mark. This need to change.
		</p>
		<h3> Participation </h3>
		<p> 
			Graphic artists only please. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skilss are necessary,but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="CSS_Resource_Guide.co.uk"> CSS Resource Guide </a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish,but not the HTML.This may seem dauting at first if you've never worked way before, but follow the listed links to learn more and use the samle files as a guide.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the sample 
			<a href="http://html_file.com"> html file </a> 
			and 
			<a href="css_file.com"> css file </a> 
			to work on a copy locally.Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit hal finished work) upload your .css file to a web server under your control. 
			<a href=" http://www.Send_us_a_link.com" > Send us a link </a> 
			to the file and if we choose to use it, we eill spider the associated images. Final submission will be placed on our server.
		</p>
		<h2>Benefits</h2>
		<p> 
			Why partecipate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to when making the case for CSS-based Design. This is sorely needed,even Today. More and more major sites are taking the leap,but not enough have. One day this gallery will be a historical curiosity; that day is not toda.
		</p>

		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<p> 
			We Would like to see ad much CSS1 as possible. CSS2 sould be limited to widely-supported elements only. The css Zen garden is about functional,pratical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge trick viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unfortunately, designing this way highlights the flaws in the various implementations of CSS.Different Browsers dispplay differently, even completely valid CSS at times, abd this become maddebubg when a fix for one leads to breakage in another. View the 
			<a href="http://www.Resources.com" > Resources </a> 
			page for information on some of the fixes avaible. Full browser compliance is still cometimes a pipe dream,and we do not expect to come up with pixel-perfect code across every platform.But do test in as many as you can. If your design doesn't work in at least IE5+/Win and Mozilla (run by over 90% of the population),chances are we won't accept it.
		</p>

		<p>
			We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copryright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimoìum;tasteful nudity is acceptable, outright pornoghraphy will be rejected.
		</p>

		<p> 
			This is a learning exercises as well as a demosgtration.You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see 
			<a href="http://www.Submission_guidlines.com"> submission guidelines </a>
			), bute we ask you release your CSS under a CReative Commons license identical to the 
			<a href="http://www.one_on_this_site.co.uk"> one on this site </a>
